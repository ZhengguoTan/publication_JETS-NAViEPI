            The pursuit of high spatial-angular-temporal resolution
            for in vivo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
            (DW-MRI) at ultra-high field strength
            (\SI{7}{\tesla} and above)
            is important in understanding brain microstructure and function.
            Such pursuit, however, faces several technical challenges.
            First, increased off-resonance and shorter $T_2$ relaxation
            require faster echo train readouts.
            Second, existing high-resolution DW-MRI techniques
            usually employ in-plane fully-sampled multi-shot EPI,
            which not only prolongs the scan time
            but also induces a high specific absorption rate (SAR)
            at \SI{7}{\tesla}.
            To address these challenges,
            we develop in this work
            navigator-based interleaved EPI (NAViEPI)
            which enforces the same effective echo spacing (ESP)
            between the imaging and the navigator echo.
            First, NAViEPI renders no distortion mismatch
            between the two echoes,
            and thus simplifies shot-to-shot phase variation correction.
            Second, NAViEPI allows for a large number of shots (e.g.~$>4$)
            with undersampled iEPI acquisition,
            thereby rendering clinically-feasible high-resolution
            sub-milliemeter protocols.

    \section{Introduction}
    \label{SEC:Intr}

    Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)
    \citep{lebihan_1986_diff,merboldt_1985_diff} is a non-invasive modality
    that is sensitive to the intravoxel Brownian motion of water molecules.
    DW-MRI forms the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) \citep{basser_1994_dmri,mori_2001_track}
    and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) \citep{tuch_2002_hardi},
    and has been widely used in acute brain ischemia diagnosis, in tumor detection and staging,
    and in neuroscience \citep{jones_2010_diff}.

    For DW-MRI acquisition, the commonly used pulse sequence is
    single-shot echo-planar imaging (SS-EPI) \citep{mansfield_1977_epi}.
    SS-EPI is capable of rapidly acquiring one DW image per radio-frequency excitation
    at the order of \SI{100}{\ms}, and is thus motion robust.
    However, conventional SS-EPI,
    even with three-fold accelerated acquisition \citep{bammer_2001_epi_sense}
    using parallel imaging
    \citep{roemer_1990_pi,ra_1993_sense,pruessmann_1999_sense,griswold_2002_grappa},
    still suffers from low spatial resolution and geometric distortions.

    \marginnote{R3.7, R3.8}
    \hl{In the quest for high spatial-angular-temporal-resolution
    and minimal-geometry-distortion DW-MRI,
    tremendous efforts have been made.
    Techniques on the correction of image distortions
    induced by off-resonances and eddy currents
    have been developed \mbox{\citep{andersson_2003_topup}}.
    Furthermore, gSlider \mbox{\citep{setsompop_2018_gslider}} with
    blipped-CAIPI \mbox{\citep{setsompop_2012_blipped}}
    for simultaneous multi-slice (SMS)
    \mbox{\citep{maudsley_1980_sms,breuer_2005_caipi}}
    was proposed to achieve high-resolution DW-MRI.}
    Advanced pulse sequences based on
    \hl{multi-shot EPI} have also been developed, \marginnote{R3.15}
    including but not limited to interleaved EPI (iEPI)
    \citep{butts_1993_iepi},
    PROPELLER \citep{pipe_2002_blade}, and
    readout-segmented EPI (rsEPI)
    \citep{porter_2009_resolve,heidemann_2010_resolve7t}.

    Based on four-shot iEPI,
    multiplexed sensitivity encoding (MUSE) image reconstruction
    achieved DW-MRI with a sub-millimeter in-plane resolution
    and maximal $b$-value \SI{800}{s/mm^2} at \SI{3}{\tesla}
    \citep{chen_2013_muse}.
    The four-shot iEPI employed in MUSE acquired
    an in-plane fully-sampled $k$-space, except partial Fourier.
    Every shot (segment), corresponding to four-fold undersampling,
    was then reconstructed via parallel imaging
    to obtain shot-to-shot phase variation.
    This indicates that increasing the number of shots in MUSE
    will result in higher undersampling per shot,
    and consequently, degrade shot phase estimation \citep{wu_2017_diff}.
    On the other hand, the use of in-plane fully-sampled four-shot iEPI
    is challenging at ultra-high field (e.g.~\SI{7}{\tesla}),
    because the SAR is linearly proportional
    to the square of the field strength.

    Alternatively, navigator-based iEPI acquisition has been proposed
    \citep{jeong_2013_navims,dai_2017_navi,dai_2018_navi}.
    These proposals may allow for a larger number of shots,
    and hence higher spatial resolution.
    However, due to the use of different ESP
    between the imaging echo and the navigator echo,
    these proposals suffered from geometric distortion mismatch
    between the two echoes and thus required specific compensation methods.
    In contrast, rsEPI \citep{porter_2009_resolve,heidemann_2010_resolve7t}
    used the same readout segment for both echoes,
    and thus required no correction of the navigator echo.

    Beyond the MUSE-type parallel imaging reconstruction,
    compressed sensing \citep{lustig_2007_cs,block_2007_cs}
    has been explored.
    For instance, multi-shot reconstruction techniques
    based on structured low-rank matrix completion (MUSSELS)
    \citep{mani_2017_mussels,bilgic_2019_neatr} achieved
    5-shot DW-MRI with 9-fold undersampling per shot.
    Recently, JULEP \citep{dai_2023_julep}
    incorporated explicit phase mapping into MUSSELS.
    These reconstruction techniques, i.e., MUSE, MUSSELS and JULEP,
    targeted the reconstruction of one DW image
    from interleaved EPI acquisition,
    and did not explore joint-$k$-$q$-space undersampling or reconstruction.

    Joint-$k$-$q$-space undersampling can be achieved
    via proper regularization along the diffusion encoding direction.
    Relevant examples are diffusion undersampling
    with Gaussian process estimated reconstruction (DAGER)
    \citep{wu_2019_dager} and
    magnitude-based spatial-angular locally low-rank regularization
    (SPA-LLR) \citep{hu_2020_spa_llr}.
    \marginnote{R1.2, R1.10}
    \hl{However, DAGER addressed the reconstruction problem
    of single-shot EPI acquisition.
    SPA-LLR focused on the reconstruction
    of single-band and fully-sampled iEPI acquisition.}

    In this work, we propose a Joint $k$-$q$-slice rEconsTruction framework
    for Shift-encoded NAVigator-based interleaved EPI
    at \SI{7}{\tesla} (dubbed JETS-NAViEPI).
    Our pulse sequence, NAViEPI, differs from most existing techniques.
    First, NAViEPI builds upon interleaved EPI, thereby allowing for
    fast and efficient $k$-space coverage.
    Second, inspired by rsEPI, NAViEPI ensures the same effective ESP
    between the imaging and the navigator echo,
    thereby minimizing geometric distortion and
    allowing for the use of a larger number of shots.
    NAViEPI essentially integrates the advantages of both iEPI and rsEPI.
    Third, NAViEPI utilizes undersampled multi-shot iEPI,
    thereby alleviating the SAR problem at \SI{7}{\tesla}.
    Fourth, NAViEPI shifts the $k$-space in-plane sampling pattern
    along the phase encoding ($k_y$) direction.
    This shifting creates complementary $k$-$q$-space sampling,
    which leads to the possibility of
    our joint $k$-$q$-slice reconstruction.
    Specifically, we employ spatial-diffusion overlapping LLR regularization
    to jointly reconstruct all diffusion encodings and multi-band slices.
    In vivo experiments at \SI{7}{\tesla} and
    comparisons with other techniques
    demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method in
    achieving high spatial resolution DW-MRI at ultra-high field.

        \label{FIG:sampling}
    \end{figure}

    % ============================== %
    \subsection{Multi-band shift-encoded iEPI acquisition}

    \cref{FIG:sampling} (A) displays the diffusion-weighted image
    acquisition based on three-shot interleaved EPI
    with three-fold in-plane undersampling.
    Conventionally, such a sampling pattern is repeated
    for all diffusion directions.
    In contrast, we propose the $k_y$-shifted diffusion encoding,
    as shown in \cref{FIG:sampling} (B).
    The interleaved EPI sampling pattern is shifted by one $k_y$ line
    per diffusion direction,
    with the cycling period being the in-plane undersampling factor.

    It is worth noting that, as shown in \cref{FIG:sampling} (A),
    the undersampling factor of one segment is
    $R_\text{in-plane} \times N_\mathrm{shot}$
    (ignore multi-band undersampling here),
    yielding nine-fold in-plane undersampling in this example.
    In other words, the undersampling factor per segment
    linearly scales up with the number of shots.
    Consequently, conventional self-gating reconstruction techniques,
    e.g.~MUSE, suffer from degraded shot-to-shot phase estimation,
    which in turn limits the number of shots and spatial resolution.

    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/fig2.png}
        \caption{The NAViEPI sequence diagram.
        SMS is utilized for the acquisition of both imaging and
        navigator echoes. While the acceleration factor per navigator is
        the same as listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ},
        the acceleration factor per imaging echo is
        in addition linearly scaled by the number of shots.}
        \label{FIG:seq}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{NAViEPI: Navigator-based iEPI with consistent effective ESP
    between the imaging and the navigator echo - where iEPI meets rsEPI}

    % TODO: \cref sequence figure
    Instead of the self-gated MUSE with in-plane fully-sampled iEPI
    and a limited number of shots,
    We propose NAVigator-based interleaved EPI (NAViEPI),
    as illustrated in \cref{FIG:seq}.
    Moreover, inspired by rsEPI \citep{porter_2009_resolve},
    NAViEPI enforces a consistent effective ESP
    between the imaging and the navigator echo,
    thereby minimizing distortion mismatch between the two echoes.

    Since one imaging echo presents
    one segment in multi-shot EPI acquisition,
    its effective ESP is defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \mathrm{ESP}_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{\mathrm{ESP}}{R_\text{in-plane} \times N_\mathrm{shot}}
        \label{EQU:Eff_ESP_Imag}
    \end{equation}
    Here, a larger number of shots (segments) increases
    the undersampling factor per segment (see \cref{FIG:sampling}),
    but decreases the effective ESP.
    Since the navigator echo is acquired for each segment,
    its in-plane undersampling factor
    equals $R_\text{in-plane}$.
    Therefore, the effective ESP of the navigator echo
    must match that of the imaging echo,
    as given in \cref{EQU:Eff_ESP_Imag}.
    With a matching effective ESP,
    the base resolution of the navigator echo
    can then be determined.

    % ============================== %
    \subsection{In vivo acquisition protocols}

    We implemented multiple in-vivo acquisition protocols
    at a clinical \SI{7}{\tesla} MR system
    (MAGNETOM Terra, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany)
    equipped with a 32-channel head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA)
    and the XR-gradient system
    \hl{(maximum gradient strength \mbox{\SI{80}{\milli\tesla / \meter}}
    with a peak slew rate of \mbox{\SI{200}{\tesla / \meter / \second}})}. \marginnote{R3.22}
    To calibrate coil sensitivity maps, reference scans employed a gradient-echo (GRE) sequence.
    Spectral fat saturation and mono-polar diffusion-encoding gradients were used.
    The phase-encoding direction was selected as anterior-to-posterior.

	As listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ}, Protocol \#1

	was implemented. This protocol represents the acquisition scheme
	employed in many existing multi-shot reconstruction techniques,
	(e.g., MUSE, SPA-LLR, and JULEP).

    \subsubsection{30-diffusion-direction acquisition

    Protocol \#2 in \cref{TAB:ACQ} was implemented
    for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) \citep{basser_1994_dmri}.
    Given the use of 30 diffusion encodings,
    we reduced the number of shots to two and switched off the navigator
    such as to shorten the total scan time.
    This is reasonable because two segments
    with three-fold in-plane undersampling
    correspond to six-fold undersampling per segment,
    which is acceptable for the self-gated phase estimation.


    \subsubsection{3-scan trace acquisition at $0.5\times0.5\times2.0$~\si{\cubic\milli\meter} voxel size}

    As listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ},
    Protocol \#3 was implemented based on
    NAViEPI with five shots per diffusion encoding.
    This protocol was compared against single-shot EPI (Protocol \#4)
    with the same spatial resolution and acceleration,
    such as to demonstrate the sampling efficiency of NAViEPI.


    % ============================== %
    \subsection{Forward modeling}
    Our proposed acquisition method yields
    multi-dimensional \hl{multi-band} \marginnote{R1.25}
    $k$-space data $\mathbf{y}_{c,q,s}$,
    where $c$, $q$, $s$ denotes the index of the coil sensitivity map,
    the diffusion encoding, and the shot, respectively.
    \hl{Acquisition modeling needs to consider several aspects}.
    \marginnote{R1.26}

    First, the acquired $k$-space data $\mathbf{y}$ is mapped from
    individual shot images $\mathbf{x}_{q,s,z}$ via the forward model,

    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{y}_{c,q,s} &= \mathbf{P}_{q,s} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\Theta}_{z} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{S}_c \mathbf{x}_{q,s,z} \nonumber \\
        \mathbf{y} &\coloneqq \mathbf{E}_1 \mathbf{x} \label{EQU:model_shot}
    \end{align}
    Here, the encoding matrix $\mathbf{E}_1$ comprises
    a chain of linear operators.
    Every shot image $\mathbf{x}$ is point-wise multiplied
    by a set of coil sensitivity maps ($\mathbf{S}$) and Fourier transformed ($\mathbf{F}$).
    The output is then point-wise multiplied by the multi-slice phase map ($\mathbf{\Theta}$)
    with $z$ the slice index in simultaneously excited slices.
    This operator shifts individual slice
    along the phase-encoding direction
    via varying phase modulation \citep{breuer_2005_caipi}.
    The SMS $k$-space data is then
    summed (collapsed, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$) along the slice dimension and
    masked (point-wise multiplied, $\mathbf{P}$) by
    the sampling pattern of \hl{each} diffusion encoding and shot.
    \marginnote{R1.27}

    % The SMS modeling in \cref{EQU:model_shot} directly encodes
    % the SMS phase shift into the forward model
    % and reflects how the pulse sequence is programmed.
    % Therefore, this physics-driven model differs from
    % other existing methods, e.g.,NEATR
    % NEATR  and JULEP

    Second, for diffusion MRI based on multi-shot EPI,
    \hl{multiple shots acquired for a given} diffusion encoding
    \marginnote{R1.28}
    need to be combined as one DW image ($\mathbf{\tilde{x}}$).
    \marginnote{R1.29}
    \hl{A possibility} is to perform magnitude average \citep{chen_2013_muse}
    or root-sum-squares (RSS) \citep{mani_2017_mussels}
    of shot images.
    This method is robust to \hl{in-plane} motion, \marginnote{R3.27}
    but sub-optimal concerning SNR
    \citep{guhaniyogi_2016_amuse}.
    Alternatively, shot combination \hl{can be done} \marginnote{R1.30}
    via shot-to-shot phase variation correction
    \citep{liu_2005_moco_diff,chen_2013_muse}.
    \hl{This can be incorporated to our formulation} \marginnote{R1.31}
    as point-wise multiplication
    between the shot-to-shot phase variation ($\mathbf{\Phi}$) and
    the DW image ($\mathbf{\tilde{x}}$),
    \begin{equation}
         \mathbf{x}_{q,s,z} = \mathbf{\Phi}_{q,s,z} \mathbf{\tilde{x}}_{q,z}
    \end{equation}
    Note that $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}$ can be obtained
    by applying the adjoint of $\mathbf{\Phi}$ to $\mathbf{x}$.
    In MUSE, $\mathbf{\Phi}$ is obtained by parallel imaging reconstruction of all shots
    with subsequent phase smoothing of every shot image.
    Based on this phase correction, the complete forward model follows
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{y} \coloneqq \mathbf{E}_2 \mathbf{\tilde{x}} = \mathbf{E}_1 \mathbf{\Phi} \mathbf{\tilde{x}}
        \label{EQU:model_dwi}
    \end{equation}
    where the encoding matrix $\mathbf{E}_2$ comprises the chain of
    the shot-to-shot phase variation $\mathbf{\Phi}$ and
    the encoding matrix $\mathbf{E}_1$.
    We implemented these two encoding matrices in SigPy \citep{ong_2019_sigpy}.


    % ============================== %
    \subsection{Joint $k$-$q$-slice reconstruction}
    \label{SUBSEC:JETS}

    % TODO: iterative phase smoothing
    Based on the generalized forward models in \cref{EQU:model_shot,EQU:model_dwi},
    our proposed joint $k$-$q$-slice reconstruction can be formulated as a three-step approach.

    \begin{enumerate}[I.]
        \item \textbf{Navigator echo reconstruction}.
        The acquisition of navigator echoes follows the forward model
        in \cref{EQU:model_shot}, so the reconstruction of navigator echoes
        can be formulated as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathrm{argmin}_\mathbf{x} \left\| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{E}_1 \mathbf{x} \right\|_2^2
            + \lambda \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x})
            \label{EQU:solve_navi}
        \end{equation}
    	where $\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x})$ denotes the regularization functional
    	with the regularization strength $\lambda$.
    	In this work, $\ell^2$ regularization was used,
    	i.e.,~$\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x}) = \left\lVert \mathbf{x} \right\rVert_2^2$.
        In the case of self-navigating (i.e., no navigator acquired) as Protocol \#2,
        the central $k$-space region (i.e., $1/4$ of the full image matrix)
        of each segment is used as $\mathbf{y}$ in \cref{EQU:solve_navi}.

        \item \textbf{Iterative phase smoothing}.
        Shot-to-shot phase variation was extracted from
        the reconstructed navigator echo phases.
        \marginnote{R1.13}
        \hl{Assuming that phase images are spatially smooth}
        \citep{chen_2013_muse,dai_2023_julep},
        we employed the iterative approach to smooth phase,
        \begin{equation}
        	\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \mathbf{F}^{-1} \mathcal{H} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{x}^{(k)}
        	\label{EQU:ITER_PHASE}
        \end{equation}
    	where the index $k$ denotes the iteration,
    	and $x^{(0)}$ is then the reconstructed navigator image from Step I.
    	$\mathcal{H}$ is the Hanning window.

        \item \textbf{Shot-combined reconstruction}.
        Joint reconstruction of all DW images using
        the shot-combined forward model $\mathbf{E}_2$
        with shot-to-shot phase variation from Step II reads:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathrm{argmin}_\mathbf{\tilde{x}} \left\| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{E}_2 \mathbf{\tilde{x}} \right\|_2^2
            + \lambda \left\| \mathbf{T} \mathbf{\tilde{x}} \right\|_*
            \label{EQU:solve_dwi}
        \end{equation}
    	Here, LLR regularization was employed in the local spatial-diffusion matrices,
    	based on the theory of \hl{partially separable functions} \marginnote{R1.35}
    	\citep{liang_2007_psf,trzasko_2011_lr,zhang_2015_llr}.
    	$\mathbf{T}$ represents a linear operator that firstly slides a local patch window
    	through all DW images and then
    	flattens every set of local \hl{patches} \marginnote{R1.36}
    	to two-dimensional (2D) matrices,
        comprising spatial and diffusion dimensions.
    	The nuclear norm regularization is enforced via
    	singular value thresholding (SVT) of all flattened 2D matrices
        \citep{cai_2010_svt}.
    	We implemented this regularization term as \hl{a proximal operator}
    	\citep{beck_2017_optim}. \marginnote{R3.28}

        \marginnote{R1.14}
        \hl{This work employed blipped-CAIPI SMS
        \mbox{\citep{setsompop_2012_blipped}},
        in which spatially separated slices are simultaneously
        excited and acquired.
        Therefore, 2D instead of 3D patches were used to
        construct the spatial-diffusion matrices.}

    	It has been reported that LLR
        is prone to checkerboard artifacts
    	when $\lambda$ is too large \citep{hu_2020_spa_llr}.
    	We overcame this problem by utilizing overlapping blocks and
    	providing an efficient implementation.
    	If the blocks overlap, $\mathbf{T}^H \mathbf{T}~\mathrm{input} \neq \mathrm{input}$,\marginnote{R3.30}
    	where $\mathbf{T}^H$ denotes the \hl{Hermitian} adjoint operator of $\mathbf{T}$.
    	This is because overlapping values are summed in the output of $\mathbf{T}^H$.
    	Our efficient implementation was to scale $\mathbf{T}^H$
    	as $(1 / \mathrm{divisor})\mathbf{T}^H$,
    	where the divisor matrix was obtained by $\mathbf{T}^H \mathbf{T}~\mathbf{1}$.
    	$\mathbf{1}$ denoted the matrix of \hl{all ones}
        \marginnote{R3.11, R3.31}
    	with the same shape as \hl{the input}.

    \end{enumerate}

    % ============================== %
    \subsection{Reconstruction}

    The acquired raw data was read in by twixtools
    (\url{https://github.com/pehses/twixtools}).
    Ramp-sampling regridding and FOV/2-ghost correction were also performed in twixtools.
    Subsequently, coil sensitivity maps were computed from reference scans
    using ESPIRiT \citep{uecker_2014_espirit} in SigPy \citep{ong_2019_sigpy}.

    With this pre-processing as well as
    \marginnote{R1.39}
    the implemented forward models and \hl{proximal operator},
    the inverse problem in \cref{EQU:solve_dwi} was solved by
    the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) \citep{boyd_2010_admm}.

    ADMM solves the minimization problems in an alternating update scheme,
    \begin{equation}
        \left\{\begin{matrix}
            \begin{aligned}
                \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} &:= \argmin_{\mathbf{x}} \norm{\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})}^2 + \rho/2 \norm{\mathbf{T}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{z}^{(k)} + \mathbf{u}^{(k)}}_2^2 \\
                \mathbf{z}^{(k+1)} &:= \mathcal{T}_{\lambda/\rho} (\mathbf{T} \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} + \mathbf{u}^{(k)}) \\
                \mathbf{u}^{(k+1)} &:= \mathbf{u}^{(k)} + \mathbf{T} \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} - \mathbf{z}^{(k+1)}
            \end{aligned}
        \end{matrix}\right.
        \label{EQU:ADMM}
    \end{equation}
    where $k$ denotes the ADMM iteration.
    $\mathbf{z}$ is the auxiliary variable ($\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{x}$),
    and $\textbf{u}$ is the Lagrangian multipliers.
    Importantly, when solving \cref{EQU:model_shot},
    $\textbf{x}$ denotes shot images and $\mathbf{E}$ denotes $\mathbf{E}_1$ in \cref{EQU:ADMM}.
    In contrast, $\textbf{x}$ denotes shot-combined images and $\mathbf{E}$ denotes $\mathbf{E}_2$
    when solving \cref{EQU:model_dwi}.
    $\mathbf{x}$ can be solved using linear least square algorithms, \marginnote{R3.35}
    e.g.~conjugate \hl{gradients} \citep{hestenes_1952_cg},
    \marginnote{R2.8, R3.32}
    while $\mathbf{z}$ is updated via \hl{singular value thresholding
    (\mbox{$\mathcal{T}$}) with the thresholding parameter \mbox{$\lambda / \rho$}}.
    The coupling parameter $\rho$ is effective in both the update of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{z}$.
    It acts as Tikhonov regularization strength when updating $\mathbf{x}$,
    but also inversely scales the thresholding strength when updating $\mathbf{z}$,
    as shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2.

    In this work, 15 ADMM iterations with $\rho = 0.05$ and $\lambda = 0.04$,
    and a block size of 6 for LLR (refer to Supporting Information Figure S3)
    were used.
    All reconstructions were done on a single A100 SXM4/\hl{NVLink} GPU \marginnote{R3.37}
    with \SI{40}{GB} memory (NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

    We compared our proposed joint reconstruction
    with established multi-shot reconstruction techniques,
    specifically, MUSE \citep{chen_2013_muse}
    and JULEP \citep{dai_2023_julep},
    \hl{hosted on GitHub by Dr.~Dai \mbox{\citep{dai_2023_julep}}.
    Further, we performed
    the local-PCA denoising \mbox{\citep{cordero_2019_cplxdwi}}
    as implemented in MRtrix \mbox{\citep{Tournier_2019_mrtrix}}
    on the MUSE reconstructed complex DW images.} \marginnote{R1.3}

    With reconstructed DW images from Protocol \#2 in \cref{TAB:ACQ},
    color-coded fractional anisotropy (cFA) maps
    \citep{basser_1994_dmri} were fitted using DiPy \citep{garyfallidis_2014_dipy},

    \subsection{Iterative smoothing of shot-to-shot phase variation}

    Navigators were acquired with the acceleration rate
    as listed in \cref{TAB:ACQ}.
    Besides, the base resolution of navigators
    (e.g.~32 in Protocol \#3 in \cref{TAB:ACQ})
    was smaller than imaging echoes.
    As a result, reconstructed navigator phases
    (refer to the first column in \cref{FIG:iter_phase})
    from Step I in \cref{SUBSEC:JETS}
    are not spatially smooth.
    Such phases, when used in the shot-combined reconstruction,
    result in signal void artifacts in DW images.
    To address this problem, we utilized the iterative smoothing procedure.
    As show in \cref{FIG:iter_phase},
    the ripple-like phase artifact disapper after five iterations.
    It can also be seen that such iterative procedure retains
    the shot-to-shot phase variation.

    The iterative phase smoothing was also applicable to
    MUSE-type self-navigating reconstruction,
    where shot phases were
    reconstructed from imaging echoes.
    \cref{FIG:4shot_comp} compares our proposed JETS with
    MUSE \citep{chen_2013_muse},
    MUSE with complex-valued local-PCA denoiser
    \citep{cordero_2019_cplxdwi},
    and JULEP \citep{dai_2023_julep}.
    The residual noise from MUSE can be largely removed
    by the denoiser. However, when compared to JETS,
    the denoiser shows residual noise patterns within
    the globus pallidus (indicated by the red arrow).
    JETS also shows better denoising than JULEP.
    The reason is that JETS enforces spatial-diffusion regularization,
    whereas JULEP formulates structured low-rank regularization
    of the four shots for one diffusion encoding.

    \subsection{\hl{Analysis of reconstruction parameters}}
    \marginnote{R1.4}

    Here we provide a systematic analysis of
    the proposed JETS reconstruction
    with LLR regularization applied to
    the spatial-diffusion dimension, as shown in \cref{FIG:ablation}.

    First, we varied the regularization strength $\lambda$
    from $0$, to $0.08$, and to $0.16$.
    The reconstruction with $\lambda = 0$ in \cref{EQU:solve_dwi}
    corresponds to parallel imaging reconstruction
    without LLR regularization.
    It is worth noting that the proposed NAViEPI sequence
    demonstrates high-quality sub-millimeter DW images
    ($0.5\times0.5\times2.0$~\si{\cubic\mm} in this example).
    The DW images can be further improved
    with the use of LLR regularization, i.e., reduced noise,
    as seen in the reconstruction with $\lambda=0.08$.
    Increasing $\lambda$ (e.g.~$0.16$) further reduces noise,
    but at the cost of increased blurring.
    Therefore, $\lambda=0.08$ was selected in this work.

    Second, besides the regularization strength,
    the block size (i.e., the width of square 2D patches) also
    plays a role in denoising.
    Here, the block size of $3$ shows the best denoising
    as compared to $6$ and $9$,
    especially in the peripheral brain region.
    According to \citep{cordero_2019_cplxdwi},
    it is suggested to keep the patch size roughly equal to
    the diffusion encoding length.
    In this 3-scan trace acquisition example,
    the diffusion encoding length is $4$
    (1 $b_0$ plus 3 orthogonal diffusion directions).
    Among the tested block sizes, $3$ is the closest to $4$,
    and hence renders better denoising,
    whereas the other block sizes may require stronger
    regularization strength.
    In practice, we also observed that smaller block sizes
    construct smaller matrices for SVT and thus
    lead to shorter computation time.

    Third, we varied the stride, i.e.,
    the increment from one local patch to the next.
    When the block size equals the stride ($6$ in this example),
    it refers to non-overlapping LLR,
    which is prone to checkerboard artifacts
    even with the use of random shifting \citep{saucedo_2017_randomshift}
    in each ADMM iteration,
    as indicated by the red arrows in the magnified views
    of \cref{FIG:ablation}.
    Therefore, we utilized the overlapping LLR with the stride of $1$,
    which requires the implementation of the scaling matrix
    in \cref{SUBSEC:JETS} to avoid the summation of overlapped pixels.
    The drawback of overlapping LLR, however, is the increased number
    of matrices for SVT and hence the increased computation time
    \citep{saucedo_2017_randomshift}.

    \subsection{\hl{Sampling efficiency of NAViEPI}}
    \marginnote{R3.5}

    As shown in \cref{FIG:0.5mm_shots},
    NAViEPI achieves sub-millimeter resolution
    (voxel size $0.5\times0.5\times2.0$~mm$^3$)
    with the use of 5-shot acquisition.
    When compared to the single-shot acquisition
    with the same voxel size,
    the acquisition time of NAViEPI is about two times longer,
    but the image quality of NAViEPI is remarkably improved.

    In the sub-millimeter imaging scenario,
    the increased base resolution requires longer TE (\SI{143}{\ms})
    in the single-shot acquisition,
    which results in significant signal loss due to $T_2$ relaxation.
    Therefore, sub-millimeter DWI necessitates multi-shot acquisition,
    which is subject to shot-to-shot phase variation and long scan time.
    However, NAViEPI solves both challenges.
    The 5-shot acquisition reduces TE to \SI{58}{\ms},
    and thus retains SNR significantly
    compared to the single-shot acquisition.
    Moreover, the JETS reconstruction can help to reduce noise
    and improve structural visibility.

    \cref{FIG:0.5mm_slice} shows the JETS reconstructed $b_0$
    and TRACE images in different slice locations.
    Admittedly, the lower brain region (e.g.~slice \#22)
    exhibits inhomogeneous and lower signal intensity
    than the upper slices.
    Such inhomogeneity can be alleviated with
    the use of multi-channel parallel transmission
    \citep{katscher_2003_ptx,grissom_2010_ptx}.

    \subsection{Diffusion tensor imaging}

    Since 30 diffusion encodings were acquired in Protocol \#2,
    the block size in LLR regularization was lifted to $6$,
    such that the spatial-diffusion matrix for SVT
    has similar width and height.
    The other parameter were kept the same as found in \cref{FIG:ablation}.

    The mean DWIs in \cref{FIG:1.0mm_dti} illustrate
    high spatial resolution and high SNR.
    In line with \cref{FIG:0.5mm_slice},
    we can notice the signal loss in the cerebellum region,
    due to the use of single-channel transmission in this work.
    On the other hand, the reconstructed cFA maps in \cref{FIG:1.0mm_dti}
    show clear fiber orientation in all orientations.
    Moreover, tiny fiber structures can be visualized
    in the zoomed-in cFA maps.
    Because of the low signal sensitivity surrounding the cerebellum,
    residual artifacts are visible in the zoomed-in sagittal view.
    To enhance the DTI fitting performance, one possibility is to
    acquire more diffusion encodings.

    \section{Discussion}
    \label{SEC:Disc}

    This work reports a novel DW-MRI technique, JETS-NAViEPI.
    NAViEPI (1) achieves the fast and efficient acquisition of
    both imaging and navigator echoes,
    (2) enforces consistent effective ESP between the two echoes, and
    (3) allows for undersampled iEPI as well as a large number of shots.
    Moreover, compared to the single-shot acquisition,
    joint $k$-$q$-slice reconstruction
    with $k_y$-shift encoding on NAViEPI
    retains SNR and reduces aliasing artifacts in DW images.
    As a result, JETS-NAViEPI renders high spatiotemporal resolution
    diffusion MRI protocols in \SI{7}{\tesla},
    e.g., 3-scan trace acquisition with the voxel size
    $0.5\times0.5\times2.0$~mm$^3$ at \SI{1.5}{\minute}.
    % (FK: This is more or less a repetition of the results section. We should discuss here what the reason for the improved performance is)

    One limitation of JETS-NAViEPI is the long reconstruction time
    due to the simultaneous reconstruction of all DW images and
    the use of overlapping locally low-rank regularization.
    The reconstruction for the Protocol \#3 in \cref{TAB:ACQ}
    \marginnote{R3.48}
    \hl{on an A100 GPU} takes about \SI{2}{\minute} per multi-band slice.
    To reduce the computation time, coil compression algorithms
    \citep{buehrer_2007_scc,huang_2008_scc}
    can be employed to reduce the number of coils for image reconstruction.
    Moreover, one may deploy multi-GPU distributed computing
    or modern optimization algorithms
    (e.g.~stochastic gradient descent) \citep{ong_2020_extreme}
    to speed up the reconstruction.

    \marginnote{R1.5}
    \hl{Neither the signal modeling in
    \mbox{\cref{EQU:model_shot,EQU:model_dwi}}
    nor the LLR regularization considers the subject motion.
    In the presence of motion, the regularized reconstruction may degrade.
    To overcome this problem, scout-informed motion estimation
    and reconstruction \mbox{\citep{polak_2022_samer}}
    could be integrated into the framework.}

    \hl{Another potential extension of this work is
    to incorporate distortion correction.
    The standard distortion correction method is
    known as TOPUP \mbox{\citep{andersson_2003_topup}},
    which acquires two scans
    with opposing phase-encoding directions to
    obtain the field inhomogeneity map and
    then performs conjugate phase reconstruction
    to correct for distortion.}

    \hl{This work employed a single regularization weight \mbox{$\lambda$}
    to enforce low rankness along the spatial-diffusion direction.
    However, SNR may be heterogeneous within the FOV.
    Therefore, one single regularization scalar may be inadequate
    to cover the whole FOV.
    Beyond this SVT-based machine-learning reconstruction,
    one may seek to learn a $q$-space prior as the regularizer
    \mbox{\citep{hammernik_2018_varnet,lam_2019_mrsi,mani_2021_qmodel}}.}


    \marginnote{R1.13}
    \hl{Although NAViEPI employs navigators for
    the acquisition of shot-to-shot phase variation,
    it is worth noting that phase behavior depends on
    several hard-to-control factors
    such as pulsatile motion, bulk motion,
    locations within the brain, and
    diffusion sensitization strength.
    Therefore, more comprehensive modeling or post-processing
    such as image registration may be considered in future work.}

    While this work reconstructs all DW images and
    then performs model fitting,
    an alternative approach is to directly estimate
    $b_0$ and diffusion tensors
    from measured $k$-$q$-space data
    using model-based reconstruction
    \citep{knoll_2015_mobadiff,dong_2018_mobadiff,shafieizargar_2023_adept}.
    Compared to DW image reconstruction,
    model-based reconstruction \hl{solves for a fewer number of unknowns}, \marginnote{R3.49}
    but requires strict diffusion tensor modeling
    and the use of nonlinear least square solvers.

    \section{Conclusions}
    \label{SEC:Conc}

    We demonstrated the JETS-NAViEPI technique, which integrates
    a $k_y$-shifted encoding interleaved EPI sequence and
    a joint reconstruction with overlapping locally low-rank regularization
    for high spatial-angular-temporal resolution DW-MRI at \SI{7}{\tesla}.
    This technique allows for high-quality DW image reconstruction
    with accelerated acquisitions.
