The pursuit of high spatial-angular-temporal resolution for in vivo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at ultra-high field strength (7T and above) is important in understanding brain microstructure and function. Such pursuit, however, faces several technical challenges. First, increased off-resonance and shorter T2 relaxation require faster echo train readouts. Second, existing high-resolution DW-MRI techniques usually employ in-plane fully-sampled multi-shot EPI, which not only prolongs the scan time but also induces a high specific absorption rate (SAR) at 7T. To address these challenges, we develop in this work navigator-based interleaved EPI (NAViEPI) which enforces the same effective echo spacing (ESP) between the imaging and the navigator echo. First, NAViEPI renders no distortion mismatch between the two echoes, and thus simplifies shot-to-shot phase variation correction. Second, NAViEPI allows for a large number of shots (e.g. larger than 4) with undersampled iEPI acquisition, thereby rendering clinically-feasible high-resolution sub-milliemeter protocols. To retain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and to reduce undersampling artifacts, we developed the ky-shift encoding among diffusion encodings to explore complementary k-q-space sampling. Moreover, we developed a novel joint reconstruction with overlapping locally low-rank regularization generalized to the multi-band multi-shot acquisition at 7T (dubbed JETS-NAViEPI).
